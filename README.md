# ✈️📊 Airline Customer Behavior Analysis  
**Final Evaluation of Module 3** | Data Analytics Bootcamp  

## Description  
Welcome to this repository, where I present a detailed analysis of customer activity in an airline loyalty program. Through this project, I explored and visualized data on flights booked, loyalty points earned and redeemed, and customer demographics.

## 🔍 Project Structure  

### 1. Data Exploration and Cleaning 🧼  
#### Initial Analysis:  
- Reviewed data quality, identifying missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.  
- Used **Pandas** to inspect the dataset's structure and key column statistics.  

#### Cleaning:  
- Addressed missing values and data consistency issues.  
- Adjusted data types and merged two tables using the unique customer identifier (`Loyalty Number`).

### 2. Data Visualization 📊  
Visualizations were key to uncovering insights about customer behavior, including:  

- **Flights Booked by Month**: Identified peaks and seasonal patterns in customer activity.  
- **Distance vs. Loyalty Points**: Analyzed the correlation between distance traveled and points earned.  
- **Geographic Distribution of Customers**: Mapped customer locations by state/province to highlight areas with the most active users.  
- **Salary by Education Level**: Compared average salaries by education level to observe potential disparities.  
- **Loyalty Card Types**: Visualized the proportion of customers using different loyalty card types, revealing user segmentation.  
- **Demographics**: Analyzed customer distribution by marital status and gender for deeper demographic insights.

#### Descriptive Analysis:  
- Grouped data by education level, calculating metrics like mean, standard deviation, and percentiles.  

#### Hypothesis Testing:  
- Conducted an A/B statistical test to evaluate significant differences in flight bookings across education levels.
